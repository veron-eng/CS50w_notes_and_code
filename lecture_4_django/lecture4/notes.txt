can create a project using: 
django-admin startproject name_of_project

manage.py is one of teh auto created files, it will be used to execute commands in our files
settings.files is just stores our configurations
urls.py is a a table of contents, and a database of urls on the webapplication that i can visit

to run the django application:
python3 manage.py runserver

this runs the web application server


one project might have multiple applications, an app for shoping, an app for videos 
django allows for multiple apps 

to create a new app you can run the command:
python3 manage.py startapp name_of_app

so when you create your new app, you can go to settings and add it to a list of installed apps in settings.py in your main project's folder

so to have something be displayed when we go to our newly created app, we can go to the apps views.py page, 
each view is something a user might want to see. to create a view you have to define it in a fuction.
a default view is called an index and takes in a request parameter which is the request the user makes

we need to tell the app when to return this response, what url is the user going to visit for the app to return this response
we need to configure this, need to create a urls.py file, django automatically creates one in the project and you need to create one for 
each app. typically the index path in urls is written like this path("", views.index, name="index")
now in the projects urls page you need to add urls for the app aswell it is typically written like this: 
path('hello/', include("hello.urls"))

to mak eit more dynamic we can instead parameterise it by doing something like this path("<str:name>", views.greet, name="greet")

to seperate things you can move the html rendering else where, and the html that is called is normally stored in a templates folder

you can dynamically insert stuff into a templates by using {{ _insert_ }}

as css files are static they are generally kept in a static folder, 
and then in the html document you can import it using <link href="{% static 'newyear/styles.css '%}" rel="stylesheet">
and at the top of the document you put {% load static %}
